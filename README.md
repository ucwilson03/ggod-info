2.	Introduction
CCRS is a web-based payment processing system which will handle the automation of processing invoices from validation to payment including the verification of payment accuracy of the invoices submitted by the Contracted Community Care Networks (CCNS). The System will generate accurate reimbursement payments according to the contract or appropriate fee schedule to the contracted entities, to automate and facilitate post payment audit activities for reimbursements and to automate and facilitate revenue operation activities such as applicable data from EDI Transmission (837) Coordination of Benefits (COB) information for 3rd party billing and 1st party copayment liability determination.
The Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO) is responsible for the coordination, communication, and execution of all CCRS configuration management activities. CCRS major releases are deployed to production approximately every 3-month. A major release is a new version of the CCRS application that includes new business capabilities, enhancements to existing functionality, and repairs to software defects. Software patches are deployed to address emerging needs or defects that impact the use of the system for stakeholders.
2.1.	Purpose of the Configuration Management Plan 
The overall objective of the CCRS Configuration Management Plan (CMP) is to identify Configuration Management (CM) roles, responsibilities, resources, formal processes, and procedures to ensure that all proposed changes to CCRS are evaluated and approved prior to implementation. This also includes the process used for controlling, evaluating, and auditing CM processes and Configuration Items (CIs) to include maintaining a current baseline configuration for CCRS. This CMP contains all the information pertinent to CCRS, inclusive of the development, test, operation, and maintenance of CCRS Configuration Items (CIs).
The CMP maintains the integrity of tasks and objectives throughout the CCRS project lifecycle. The CCRS approach to CM is consistent with government and industry best practices. The overall managerial structure and hierarchy of CCRS CM organizations is described in this plan. This CMP establishes the proper identification of each CI, controls changes and baselines the documentation describing them, performs audits to verify the deployment, configuration, and performance of each CI, as well as facilitates communication among team members, users, and other stakeholders. It implements the requirements of the CM directive and applies to all CM activities within CCRS.
