# Configuration Management at VA

Configuration management involves identifying product configuration items, controlling these configuration items and changes to them, and recording and reporting status and change activity on configuration items

EPMO Configuration Management (Epmo_CM) supports teams in managing the VA product (and its components) and product integrity. EPMO_CM is responsible for configuration management systems, standards, configuration baselines, and deployment services. We work directly with project teams to determine how best to support configuration management on your project to ensure best practices for configuration management, ensure code integrity, authoritative source identification, visibility across products, and auditing/validation for Office of Inspector General (OIG), security requirements, and product retention.

Our services are:

     Establishing the project in the tools  

     Establishing current to future CM state and action planning

     Action plans and coaching on VA configuration standards and processes.

     Identification and version management of CIs, their relationships, and information in repositories.

     Managing source (code and documents) in transitioning repositories, baselining and creating product builds

     Defining CM procedures for team file management during development (CM Plan and planning)

     Developing VDDs for product integrity and CM standard consistency

We use issues labeled "CM Request" with the title of "CM service request" to allocate resources once the request has been submitted.

The Version Description Document (VDD) is:

A technical “parts list” with version information and the authoritative inventory of all components that make up the deployable product/system. Components include source code files, builds/packaging, tools, baselines, locations, and associated product and document files.  The VDD is “the” authoritative inventory of all components that make up the deployable product/system.  A VDD is a technical road map to the product and provides the evidence of assurance that NIST Special Publications 800-53 and 800-128 has been meet by executing the Product Configuration Management Plan and the Security Settings Configuratoin Management Plan. 

We use issues labeled "VDD" with the title of "New Version Description Document" to allocate resources once the VDD has been created. Our team will review, audit and provide guidance for any corrective action that might be discovered in the VDD audit.
